        This pumpkin cheese ball is a fun make-ahead appetizer for Thanksgiving or Halloween. You can use your favorite cheese, e.g. smoked or flavored cheese and cream cheese are good options</p>
       <h2>ingredients</h2>
       <ul>
        <li>2 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon bottled hot pepper sauce

</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 cups finely shredded yellow Cheddar cheese

</li>
        <li>1 stem from a bell pepper</li>
        <li>crackers for serving</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>Steps</h3>
       <ol >
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Combine cream cheese, hot pepper sauce, paprika, and garlic in a food processor. Process until well combined.</li>
        <li>Add 1 1/2 cups shredded cheese and process until cheese is finely chopped but still very visible.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle about 3 tablespoons of the remaining shredded cheese into a 4-inch pile on a large piece of plastic wrap, and top with a rounded scoop of the cheese ball mixture.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the cheese ball mound with the remaining shredded cheese.</li>
        <li>Pull sides of plastic wrap up and over the cheese ball mixture to wrap tightly and shape into a ball. (If needed, wrap with an additional piece of plastic wrap to ensure the mixture is very tightly wrapped.)</li>
        <li>Wrap 4 wide rubber bands around the cheese ball, evenly spacing them to create the indentations that are found on a pumpkin. (Depending on the size of the rubber bands, you may need to double wrap each one to create indentations that are deep enough.)

</li>
        <li>Chill cheese ball in the refrigerator at least 3 hours before serving to allow flavors to meld and the cream cheese to become firm.

</li>
        <li>Before serving, remove rubber bands and unwrap cheese ball. Place a bell pepper stem on top of the pumpkin and gently press to adhere. Serve with crackers.</li>
    
       </ol>
